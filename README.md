# Bible Study App
Users can join groups, do Bible studies, and keep track of prayer requests. Note that this is a work in progress!

There are four main tabs:

# Profile
Users can look at their saved verses, saved Bible studies, a personal reflection journal, and their groups.

# Studies
Here, users can see their most recent study, past studies, recommended studies, popular studies, or browse by theme. They can also search for a specific study or create a new study. By clicking on a study from the main page, users can see which group(s) is doing that study, some about info, and the verses the study covers. They also can open the Bible in the app to view the verses. Included with each study is a reflection forum and study tools like context, commentaries, guiding questions, and maps.

# Prayer Board
Keep track of all of your prayers in one place! The main prayer board page is a collection of all prayers that are involved in the user's groups in addition to their own personal prayers. Each prayer is simply an image with a description for now, but that may change later. If a user would like to see the prayers from one specific group, they can find those in the pages of their groups.

# Groups
Here, users can see all of their groups, browse groups, join groups, and create groups. Each group has a record of past Bible studies and their own personal prayer board.
